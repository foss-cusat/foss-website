Welcome to the official repository of the **FOSS CUSAT** club website!

## 🚀 About FOSS CUSAT

**FOSS CUSAT** is a student-led initiative at Cochin University of Science and Technology (CUSAT) dedicated to promoting **Free and Open Source Software** (FOSS) within our university community.  
We aim to foster a culture of openness, collaboration, and knowledge-sharing through talks, workshops, contributions, and community-driven projects.

This website serves as our digital presence — a place to discover upcoming events, explore our work, and join the movement.
